## How it works
Plugin is ready to use once it is installed and the browser window is refreshed.
- A transfer button is added to the task canvas.
- Clicking this button pops an agent and queue directory.
- Against every agent or queue in the directory there are transfer and consult buttons.
- Agent can click Transfer to initiate a cold transfer and wrap up.
- Or the agent can choose Consult to start a 3 way chat with another agent (warm transfer).
- Chat history is visible to the transferred agent.
